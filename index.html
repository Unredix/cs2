              Counter-Strike 2 is a multiplayer tactical first-person shooter,
              in which two teams, the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists,
              compete to complete different objectives, depending on the game
              mode selected. Most game modes play out over several rounds;
              in-between rounds, players are able to purchase different weapons
              and equipment to use.

              Valve developed Counter-Strike 2 with the Source 2 game engine as
              an update to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (2012). Various
              aspects of Global Offensive were updated during development to use
              the features of Source 2. It is the first entry in the
              Counter-Strike series in over ten years.

              As with Global Offensive, Counter-Strike 2 employs a free-to-play
              model; players are able to access the majority of the game's
              contents without paying an up-front fee, with the exception of the
              Premier game mode, access to which requires the purchase of a
              "Prime" status upgrade. Players who choose to purchase the Prime
              upgrade also obtain access to a weekly "care package" drop, which
              they earn through gaining experience points and leveling up their
              profile within a Prime-exclusive leveling system.
